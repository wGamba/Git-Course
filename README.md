 ### Version Control System

 #### What is a Version Control System?

 A version control system (VCS) is a tool that helps you keep track of changes to files over time. It allows you to revert to previous versions, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of your code.

#### Why is Version Control System important?

* **Performance** : Only the requiered data is saved.
* **Security** : Saves every action.
* **Flexibility**: Linear development is not required.

### History
* **1990**: Early VCS tools like RCS and CVS emerged.

* **2005**: Linus Torvalds created Git for Linux kernel development.

* **2008**: GitHub launched, boosting Git's adoption. It was initially created using Ruby.

* **2018**: Microsoft acquired GitHub, further expanding its reach.

* **2025**: GitHub leads the market with AI-driven features and advanced collaboration tools.


### What is Git?

Git stores a full repository copy locally, enabling offline work, and syncs with remote repositories for collaboration and backups.

### What is a repository?

A repository, often referred to as a "repo," is a storage location where your project's files and their revision history are managed. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (hosted on platforms like GitHub). Repositories enable collaboration, version tracking, and centralized management of your codebase.
